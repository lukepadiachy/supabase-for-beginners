So how do I set up my account for **Supabase** ? well its quite a quick process

## **Getting Started**

1. **Sign Up for Supabase**: Create an account on [supabase](https://supabase.com/). This will grant you access to the Supabase dashboard where you can manage your projects.

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - **Project Name**: Choose a unique name for your project.
   - **Password**: Set a strong password for your database.
   - **Region**: Select the region closest to your user base for optimal performance.
   - For detailed steps, refer to the [Supabase Getting Started Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started).

3. **Retrieve API Keys**:
   - **anon key**: Used for client-side operations.
   - **service_role key**: Intended for server-side operations with elevated privileges.
   - To find and manage your API keys, navigate to the "Settings" > "API" section in your Supabase project dashboard.

4. **Set Up Development Tools (Optional)**:
   - **Supabase CLI**:
     - **Installation**: Follow the instructions in the [Supabase CLI Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) to install the CLI on your operating system.
   - **Docker**:
     - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine, as Supabase relies on Docker for local development.
     - Download it from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

5. **Familiarize Yourself with PostgreSQL**:
   - Supabase uses PostgreSQL as its underlying database. Having a basic understanding of PostgreSQL will be beneficial.
   - For more information, visit the [PostgreSQL Official Site](https://www.postgresql.org/).

6. **Set Up Authentication (Optional)**:
   - In the Supabase dashboard, navigate to "Authentication" > "Settings" > "Providers".
