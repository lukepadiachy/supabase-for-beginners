# What is Supabase?

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase that helps developers build secure and scalable applications quickly. It uses PostgreSQL, a powerful relational database, as its foundation, providing flexibility and super features. Being open-source means you can view, modify, and host the code yourself, giving you more control and avoiding being tied to a single provider. [Learn more](https://supabase.com/)
