# 💡 Tips and Common Issues

This section is your go-to guide for practical tips and solutions to common challenges in Supabase. Whether you're troubleshooting an issue or looking for ways to improve your workflow, these insights can help.

## 🛠️ Tips

### **Organize Your Projects**

- **Use Clear Naming Conventions**: Assign descriptive names to your projects, tables, and columns to maintain clarity and ease of management.
- **Leverage Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Ensure RLS is enabled to control access to your data, protecting sensitive information and ensuring users only access what they're permitted to see. [Learn more about RLS](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/secure-data).

### **Utilize Development Tools**

- **Employ an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)**: Using an ORM can simplify database interactions and enhance productivity. [Discover the benefits of using an ORM with Supabase](https://medium.com/@lior_amsalem/3-biggest-mistakes-using-supabase-854fe45712e3).
- **Set Up the Supabase CLI**: The Supabase CLI streamlines local development and deployment processes. [Get started with the Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started).

### **Optimize Performance**

- **Monitor Resource Allocation**: Regularly check your project's resource usage to ensure optimal performance. [Understand how to monitor and optimize resources in Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/performance).
- **Use Edge Functions Wisely**: Leverage Edge Functions for serverless computing, but be mindful of potential CORS issues and deployment challenges. [Learn best practices for Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/troubleshooting).

### **Engage with the Community**

- **Learn from Others' Experiences**: Participate in discussions and learn from the experiences of other Supabase users. [Join the Supabase discussions](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/categories/troubleshooting).

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### **Edge Function Deployment Failures**

- **Cause**: Deployment issues can arise from outdated CLI versions or misconfigurations.
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure you're using the latest version of the Supabase CLI.
  - Review deployment logs for specific error messages.
  - Consult the [Supabase Edge Functions troubleshooting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/troubleshooting) for detailed solutions.

### **CORS Issues with Edge Functions**

- **Cause**: Misconfigured CORS settings can prevent your Edge Functions from being called correctly.
- **Solution**:
  - Follow the [CORS guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/troubleshooting) to configure CORS settings properly.
  - Check your function logs in the Supabase Dashboard for any errors or warnings.

### **Slow Response Times**

- **Cause**: High traffic volumes or inefficient queries can lead to slower response times.
- **Solution**:
  - Upgrade to a larger compute add-on to handle increased traffic.
  - Optimize your SQL queries for better performance.
  - Consider using fewer Postgres connections to reduce resource consumption. [Learn more about diagnosing HTTP API issues](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/troubleshooting/http-api-issues).
